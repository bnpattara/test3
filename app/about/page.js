            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              NatureBuff was born from a simple observation during a hiking trip in 2018. Our founder, Max Velinsky,
              noticed the amount of non-biodegradable waste left behind on trails â€“ particularly wet wipes and plastic
              containers from hygiene products.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
              Inspired to make a change, Max began researching sustainable alternatives to conventional hygiene
              products. He discovered that bamboo-based wipes could provide the same convenience without the
              environmental impact, and that natural soap bars could eliminate the need for plastic bottles.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              After two years of development and testing, NatureBuff launched its first products in 2020. Today, we're
              proud to offer a growing range of sustainable hygiene solutions that help outdoor enthusiasts, travelers,
              and eco-conscious individuals reduce their environmental footprint without sacrificing cleanliness or
              convenience.
