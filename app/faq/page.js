                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Our Buff Wipes are made from 100% biodegradable bamboo fiber and will naturally break down in 4-6
                  weeks in compost or soil conditions. This is significantly faster than conventional wipes, which can
                  take 100+ years to decompose due to their plastic content.

                  Yes, our soap bars are formulated with biodegradable, plant-based ingredients that are safe for use in
                  natural water sources. They don't contain harmful chemicals like parabens, sulfates, or synthetic
                  fragrances that can damage aquatic ecosystems. However, we still recommend using them at least 200
                  feet away from water sources when possible, following Leave No Trace principles.

                  With regular use, our standard-sized soap bars (3.5oz/100g) typically last 3-4 weeks. To extend the
                  life of your soap, we recommend keeping it in a dry place between uses and using our bamboo soap dish
                  or travel container to allow proper drainage.

                  We carefully select suppliers who share our commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. Our
                  bamboo comes from FSC-certified forests that don't contribute to deforestation or habitat destruction.
                  Essential oils and other plant-based ingredients are sourced from organic farms whenever possible. We
                  regularly audit our supply chain to ensure compliance with our standards.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  The ideal disposal method is home composting, where our wipes will break down in 4-6 weeks. If
                  composting isn't available, they can go in regular trash where they'll still biodegrade much faster
                  than conventional wipes. Please note that even though our wipes are biodegradable, they should never
                  be flushed down toilets as they can still cause clogs in plumbing systems.
